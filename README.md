# :game_die: Tenzies 

My first React project on my journey to learing React. It is a spin off from one of the capstone projects on the [Learn React for free coure](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) by [Bob Ziroll](https://twitter.com/bobziroll). 

Bob is an amazing tutor and I highly recommend this course for anyone trying to get their hands dirty with React.
